            "description": "“I can't think of anyone else who is a greater source of meta than Donald Trump.”Steven Steele, chief marketing officer of MAGA Memecoin (CRYPTO: TRUMP), the Trump-themed cryptocurrency that has been making waves for being the former president’s biggest portfolio holding, thinks it is “increasingly likely” the 45th president becomes the 47th president of the United States.In that case, we could be provided with “four more years of hilarity and catalysts,” Steele told Benzinga in an interview. Polls have the former and the current presidents neck-and-neck, as have prediction markets, which gave Trump a two-point edge over Joe Biden, as of May 4.

It was the first to successfully introduce a meme coin based on a real-world person or cultural phenomenon. Speculating on the attention created by certain events, such as the death of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, has since become a staple of the meme coin circus.Steele, who initially was just an investor in TRUMP, said the “enormous potential” made him join as chief marketing officer. Following its inception in August 2023, TRUMP grew to a preliminary peak of $448 million in market capitalization on March 5 and is currently trading around a valuation of $220 million.Steele attributes this rise in value to several key points:Consistent marketing: MAGA Memecoin ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",
